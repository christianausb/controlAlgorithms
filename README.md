A (basic) implementation for the identification of non-linear systems implemented using the machine learning library JAX (https://github.com/google/jax). Herein, automatic differentiation of the system model and the through the ODE solver is used to enable gradient-based optimization approaches.

An example notebook describing the identification for a pendulum is provided https://nbviewer.org/github/christianausb/controlAlgorithms/blob/main/sysident.ipynb
